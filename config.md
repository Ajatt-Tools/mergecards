## Merge Notes configuration

**Anki needs to be restarted after changing the config.**

* `shortcut` - A key combination used to perform a merge.
* `delete_original_notes` - Delete original cards after merging.
* `merge_tags` - Merge tags of selected notes in addition to fields contents.
* `reverse_order` - Sort cards by their due number in reverse,
so a card with the biggest due number will receive the content of other selected cards.
* `field_separator` - This string is inserted between the merged fields.
Empty by default. A common option would be to change it to a single space: `" "`.
