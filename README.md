Suppose you have a subs2srs deck. Usually many sentences in the deck are split between multiple notes.
This addon adds a button to the card browser that allows you to merge contents of selected cards.

## Features

To open quick settings, click **Edit â†’ Merge Fields Settings** in the Anki Browser.
2) Ability to specify `fields separator`.
You can decide what string is inserted as a separator between the merged fields.
3) Merge tags of selected cards.
4) Delete original notes after merging.
5) Sort cards by their `Due` number or `Sort Field` before performing a merge.
