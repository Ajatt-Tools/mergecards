# mergenotes
Suppose you have a subs2srs deck. Usually many sentences in the deck are split between multiple notes.
This addon adds a button to the card browser that allows you to merge contents of selected cards.
Cards are sorted by their due number, so fields of a card with bigger due number will be added to
a card with lower due number.
