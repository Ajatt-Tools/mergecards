# mergecards
Suppose you have a subs2srs deck. Usually many notes in the deck have split sentences.
This addon adds a button to the card browser that allows you to merge content of selected cards.
Cards are sorted by due number, so content of a card with bigger due number will be added to
a card with lower due number.
